                <th> Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood has told us that the question of whether her party could join a coalition with Labour remains part of an “ongoing debate”. But on the eve of the Plaid Autumn Conference, she claimed her party is making a
                    success of the double-handed role it has chosen to adopt at the National Assembly. While remaining in opposition, Plaid this week struck a £119m Welsh Budget deal with Labour which senior representatives of the party claim will improve
                    the lives of everyone in Wales. On Friday, Plaid delegates from across Wales will congregate in Llangollen for their two-day conference. </th>
