      <tr class="description"> <th> Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood has told us that the question of whether her party could join a coalition with Labour remains part of an “ongoing debate”.
                                    But on the eve of the Plaid Autumn Conference, she claimed her party is making a success of the double-handed role it has chosen to adopt at the National Assembly.
                                    While remaining in opposition, Plaid this week struck a £119m Welsh Budget deal with Labour which senior representatives of the party claim will improve the lives of everyone in Wales.
                                    On Friday, Plaid delegates from across Wales will congregate in Llangollen for their two-day conference. </th></tr>

      <tr> <th class="description"> An extra £240m for the NHS has been announced in the Welsh budget.
                                    Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford also promised £10m for a pilot scheme to provide 30 hours of free childcare for three and four year olds.
                                    There are cuts to some areas of local government and community projects, plus the end of the £20m Schools Challenge Cymru scheme.
                                    But total spending rose by 2.7% to £14.95bn, according to published figures. </th></tr>

                Some will even get a modest increase but that will still be wiped out by inflation. </tr> </th>
